# Example: CXX demo

This example tries to replicate [the CXX demo](https://github.com/dtolnay/cxx/tree/master/demo) using Zngur. It tries to keep it as close
as possible to the original CXX example, so it doesn't use Zngur features that may make the code easier, more readable, and more
performant. To see an example that uses all Zngur features in C++ to Rust codes, go to s2 example.

To run this example:

```
cargo run
```
